# portfolio1
What my goal was for this website is to create a website that includes a small "about me" sharing a little bit about me and my family.
I also have a portfolio page that is set up with school history and recenet work history. I also added icons of each school and empolyee.
The last section will be a "contact me" were you can send me a email for future job opportunities.
Lastly I used bootcamp and a little css to get the website to where it is now!
ALSO YOU HAVE TO HAVE FUN!!


ENJOY!
